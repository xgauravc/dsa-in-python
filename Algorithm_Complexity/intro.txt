 -> Techniques to measure time Efficiency

 1. Measuring time to execute.
 2. Counting operation involved.
 3. Abstract notion of order of growth.

    1. Measuring time 

    Directly measuring time

    2. Counting operations involved

    counting number of operation involved

    3. Order of growth
    
    prerequisites-

    what do we want -
    Evaluate the Algorithm
    Evaluate Scalability
    Evaluate in terms of input size


    #Cases
    Taking example of finding an elelment in an array 
    Best case -  1st element  is that element
    Avg case - The element is in the middle
    Worst case - The element is in last

    //Always think for worst case while writing a program

    #Goals
    Evaluate program's efficiency when input is very big 
    Express the growth of progam's run time as input size grows
    Want to put an upperbound on growth - as tight as possible 
    We will lok at the largest factors, which eill takes longest time in run time
